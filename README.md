 #Gold Price Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis (ARIMA & SARIMA)#
This project delves into time series analysis and forecasting of monthly gold prices utilizing the ARIMA and SARIMA models. It comes equipped with a Streamlit web application that enables interactive exploration, model selection, and dynamic forecasting.

Project Highlights
Time Series Workflow:

Data Acquisition: Fetch gold price data via Yahoo Finance

Trend Visualization: Plot time-based price movements

STL Decomposition: Separate trend, seasonality, and noise

Stationarity Testing: Apply ADF test to check stationarity

Differencing: Stationarize the series

ACF & PACF Plots: Identify model orders

Model Building: Implement ARIMA & SARIMA models

Forecasting: Predict the next 12 months

Model Comparison: Evaluate models using AIC/BIC

Model Persistence: Save models with pickle

Streamlit Web Application:

Model Selection: Choose between ARIMA and SARIMA

Forecasting: Predict for up to 36 months ahead

Visualization: Display forecasts with confidence intervals

Raw Data: Access historical data and model summary

SARIMA	Evaluated	‚úÖ Yes	Differenced	Seasonal-aware

ACF & PACF Interpretation
ACF (Autocorrelation Function):

Spikes at seasonal lags indicate the need for seasonal terms in SARIMA.

Cut-off after lag p suggests the AR order.

Cut-off after lag q suggests the MA order.

Sample ADF Test Output
yaml
Copy
ADF Statistic: -1.56
p-value: 0.51
Conclusion: Time series is **non-stationary**. Differencing required.
